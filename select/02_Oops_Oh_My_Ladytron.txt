There goes my shirt, up over my head
OH MY
(OOPS)There goes my skirt, droppin at my feet
OH MY
(OOPS)Some kind of touch, caressing my face
OH MY
(OOPS)I'm turning red
Who could this be?

Tell you what i did last night, i came home, say about a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and--tantalizing
You woulda thought i needed help, from this feeling that i felt
So shook i had to catch my breath

(OOPS)There goes my shirt up over my head
OH MY
(OOPS)There goes my skirt, droppin at my feet
OH MY
(OOPS)Some kind of touch, caressing my face
OH MY
(OOPS)I'm turning red
Who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid but this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it Ride, and party
But this body felt just like mines and
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

(OOPS)There goes my shirt, up over my head
OH MY
(OOPS) There goes my skirt, droppin at my feet
OH MY
(OOPS)Some kind of touch, caressing my face
OH MY
(OOPS)I'm turning red
Who could this be?
